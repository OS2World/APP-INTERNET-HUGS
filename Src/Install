   1024 Mar  2 05:00 src/            Interpreter source code

The following procedure is suggested for installation of Hugs on a
Unix machine (see separate files included in the full distribution
for installation on other machines, for example, PCs).

 0) Compile the interpreter by editing src/Makefile, selecting the
    desired operating system/compiler configuration in src/prelude.h
    and running make.  Not all of the combinations listed in the
    prelude.h file have been tested recently, so please report any
    problems and updates to me.

 1) Choose a directory for the Hugs files to go, say /usr/local/lib/Hugs
    and copy hugs.prelude and the executable from step (1) into this
    directory.  Ensure that these files have appropriate permission
    settings.  If you like, move demos to this subdirectory also.

 2) Edit the script file `hugs' to point to the directory chosen in
    step (1) and to set any preferred command line arguments.  Copy
    this script file into a suitable directory; your own bin directory,
    for example, or a system wide directory like /usr/local/bin.
