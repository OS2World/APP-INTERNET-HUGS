How to install the OS/2 version of HUGS v1.01
---------------------------------------------

1) Unzip hugs101o.zip. (use Info-unzip, not PKunzip)
   The file hugs101o.zip already contains the correct directory structure.
   (\Progs\HUGS)

2) The emx-package must be installed (e.g. the file emx.dll must be in a
   directory named in the LIBPATH-statement of your CONFIG.SYS)
   If emx isn't installed yet, get the file emxrt.zip and install the
   emx-runtime package following the instruction in the readme-file.
   How to get emxrt.zip:
     Try ftp://ftp-os2.nmsu.edu
      or ftp://ftp.uni-stuttgart.de/pub/systems/os2/

3) Edit your CONFIG.SYS (make a copy FIRST!) and add the HUGS-directory to
   the PATH-statement:
       SET PATH=...;\Progs\HUGS;...
   Add the following statements:
       SET SHELL=\os2\cmd.exe
       SET HUGS=\Progs\HUGS\hugs.prelude
     (The variable SHELL must point to the correct location of your OS/2
      command-interpreter, usually cmd.exe)
   If you want to use your own editor (HUGS takes tedit.exe as default)
   specify it by adding the statement:
       SET EDITOR=\mydirectory\myeditor.exe

4) reboot your system to let the changes take effect.

5) Have fun with your HUGS!
